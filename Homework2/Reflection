Now that I recall to do this...

Using ChatGPT was rather helpful for me. It helped me figure out where certain key componets need to sit in the code to work properly.
This stuff is terribly confusing for me, so while it kind of feels wrong...the fact that GPT is so helpful is nice. 
When asked to create its own code though, i tried to stick to a similar set of rules that we had for our own assigment. 
It still went far more in depth with its additions, adding in things that I dont even recall in Coding I. 
Personally I think it seems far more complex than my own, for literally just basic shapes. 
So while the system is incredibly handy to have, I really dont want it to do all the work for me. A handy tool to have as an extra stand.
I barely survivied the first class, so I can't deny i really hope that this will be a better time around with an extra tool to use.
