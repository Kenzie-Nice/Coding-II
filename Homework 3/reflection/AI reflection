I used a different source for my AI this time, and hopefully following along that it doesn't have to be rather specific. 
https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img, or DeepAI.org. 
which demanded to be far more specific in wording than my previous one, where i just had chatGPT create a code from scratch
to recreate something. Wherein this one, particular for an image demanded that you be the descriptive one of what you wanted. 
In the end it still whipped it out like it was nothing, pulling from refernece sources to create the false art. Still insane 
to mess with and rather interesting as well.
