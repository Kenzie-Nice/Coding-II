I'm just happy it appears now...ill take what little I get. 

Though on that note, I did have to use chatgpt to help configure the code to work properly in p5.js
as often my arrays were declared to be written wrongly, such as "MyImages" was constantly asked to be changed to just
"images" but inwhere it would then procede to tell me it could not locate the file.......
essentially i was led from one dead end to another.
